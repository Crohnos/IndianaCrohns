- 👋 Hi, I’m @IndianaCrohns
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, healthcare information systems, global priorities research, and trumpet

Read onward to hear about my career journey:
- As part of my master's degree in Information Systems from Texas A&M, I gained academic experience in Python, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and Alteryx. From projects as simple as data analysis to web scraping, I acquired a foundation for my skills from university courses.
- After graduating I went on to work as an IT Auditor for PwC in Dallas, where the extent of my technical functions were to clean data and perform routine internal controls testing. I hated the monotony of audit/assurance, and so left the company to pursue other opportunities.
- Since January, I had several medical procedures done to improve my physical health, and extensive mental health treatments in the form of psychotherapy and effective medication. During this time I did not have the opportunity to work on my career, but it has certainly been worth the peace and healthy lifestyle I acquired.
- In recent months I have been refreshing my knowledge of Python basics and implementations most of all; I have greatly enjoyed working with data, as I have always been drawn to statistics, mathematics, and strategic decision making. I'm so excited to dive in to the field of data science that I've found myself filling my days with working on personal projects and modeling in Python :)
- My communication skills and presentability are exemplary compared to the grand majority of my colleagues in STEM (not they are inept in this area :P); attending Mays Business School has afforded me the skills to be able to present information, collaborate with a team, and build a history of strong commitment and ethics.
